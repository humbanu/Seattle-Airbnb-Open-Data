# Seattle-Airbnb-Open-Data
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.
## Project Insights 

Based on the Cross-Industry Standard Process of Data Mining (CRISP-DM), the Airbnb data shared since 2008 is studied. The project is intended to understand busiest booking seasons and pricing predicitons. The questions answered and analyzed through this project:
* Airbnb Price Booking Trends in Seattle:
* What are the most popular booked property types in Seattle?
* What are the peak booking months in Seattle?
* What are the most and least popular locations to book based on price?
* What are the most and least popular locations to book based on Reviews?


## Installation
The project was implemented using Anaconda distribution of Python 3.0. Moreover I have used the following python libraries:
Collections

NumPy
Pandas. 
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
the data set is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).

## File Descriptions
The Jupyter notebook showcases the analysis done  to explore the dataset, the data preparation and wrangling as well as the building of prediction models in order to answer the questions above.
